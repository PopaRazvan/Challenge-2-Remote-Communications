    <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 130%;">Observe the existing affordances, visual variables and interaction flows for a
            given use case - for example,
            delivering an academic presentation or attending a specific meeting at late hours - and propose better
            approaches (if any). </li>

        <p>&nbsp;
            For delivering an academic presentation, the existing affordances and interaction flows for Zoom and
            Microsoft Teams are fairly similar. Both platforms offer the ability to share your screen, use a virtual
            background, and utilize various annotation tools to make the presentation more interactive. However, there
            are some improvements that can be made to enhance the user experience.
        </p>


        <h2 style="font-size: 110%;">Affordances:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Screen sharing: allows the presenter to share their screen with the audience.</li>
            <li>Meeting recording: allows the presenter to record the meeting for future reference.</li>
            <li>Chat window: allows the audience to ask questions or make comments.</li>
            <li> Video window: displays the presenter's video feed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="font-size: 110%;"> Visual Variables:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Meeting notes: enable the presenter and audience to collaborate on a shared document.
            </li>
            <li>
                Audio controls: allow the presenter to mute or unmute themselves and other participants.
            </li>
            <li>Live captions: provide real-time captioning for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="font-size: 110%;">
            Interaction Flows:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The presenter shares their screen and starts their presentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                The audience watches the presentation and can ask questions via chat or voice.
            </li>
            <li>The presenter can use annotation tools to emphasize specific points.</li>
            <li>The presenter and audience can collaborate on meeting notes or collaborative whiteboards.</li>
            <li>The meeting can be recorded for future reference.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="font-size: 110%;">
            Better Approaches:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving the meeting recording feature by automatically saving the recording to Teams and providing
                easy
                access to it for future reference.</li>
            <li>Enhance the annotation tools by providing more options, such as highlighting, underlining, and adding
                text
                boxes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>

        <li style="font-size: 130%;">Compare the visual metaphors and idioms and suggest the similar ones for a
            text-only interaction (see CLI - Command Line Interface).
        </li>

        <p>&nbsp;
            When it comes to text-only interaction in a Command Line Interface (CLI), visual metaphors and idioms are
            replaced by text-based commands. To improve the experience of text-only interaction, clear and concise
            instructions and feedback are essential. Consistent and intuitive command syntax can also help reduce
            cognitive overload.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;
            Visual metaphors and idioms used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Zoom and Microsoft Teams include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>"Raise your hand" - This idiom is used in both Zoom and Microsoft Teams to describe the action of
                indicatingthat you want to speak during a meeting.
            </li>

            <p>To suggest a similar idiom for a text-only interaction, we could use the phrase "signal to speak" or
                "indicate to speak" to describe the action of indicating that we want to speak during a CLI-based
                meeting.
            </p>

            <li>"Mute/unmute" - This idiom is used to describe the action of turning
                off/on your microphone during a meeting.</li>

            <p>To suggest a similar idiom for a text-only interaction, we could use the phrases "silence/unsilence" to
                describe the action of turning off/on your microphone.
            </p>

            <li>"Chat" - This idiom is used to describe the feature that allows you to
                send instant messages to other participants during a meeting.</li>

            <p>To suggest a similar idiom for a text-only interaction, we could use the phrase "instant messaging" or
                "text chat" to describe the feature that allows users to send messages to other participants.
            </p>
        </ul>

        <li style="font-size: 130%;">Discuss the cognitive overload in special conditions/contexts. </li>
        <p>&nbsp;
            Cognitive overload can occur when the user is presented with too much information or too many options,
            resulting
            in difficulty in processing and decision making. Special conditions/contexts that can exacerbate cognitive
            overload include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Multitasking: When users try to do too many things at once during a virtual meeting, they may experience
                cognitive overload. For example, if someone is trying to take notes, listen to the speaker, and respond
                to
                chat messages simultaneously, they may struggle to process all the information effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                Technical difficulties: When technical issues arise during a virtual meeting, such as poor audio quality
                or
                slow internet speeds, users may have to work harder to process the information being presented. This can
                lead to cognitive overload, particularly if the issue persists for an extended period.
            </li>
            <li>Large group meetings: When there are a large number of participants in a meeting, it can be challenging
                to
                keep track of who is speaking and what they are saying. This can lead to cognitive overload as the brain
                tries to process multiple streams of information at the same time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <li style="font-size: 130%;">List minimum three improvements that can be made to optimize these applications
            from the point of view of the main audience on at least two platforms â€“ for instance, Web + mobile native,
            desktop native + mobile native. Each improvement will be listed in pairs: UI/UX problem identified &
            solution suggested.
        </li>

        <p>&nbsp;
            Let's consider four UI/UX improvements for Zoom and Microsoft Teams that can optimize the experience
            for
            the main audience across different platforms:
        </p>


        <p>&nbsp;
            Problem: Inconsistent navigation and interface design between platforms can make it difficult for users to
            switch between devices and maintain a consistent experience.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            Solution: To use a consistent design system and navigation structure across all platforms, with common
            visual
            elements and interaction patterns to help users quickly acclimate to the platform on any device. This can
            include consistent use of color, typography, icons, and spacing, as well as a common hierarchy of navigation
            elements.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            Problem: Participants' video feeds can be distracting or overwhelming during large meetings</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            Solution: Provide the option for the user to turn off video feeds for participants who are not speaking or
            minimize the video feeds to thumbnail size. This can help the presenter and participants focus on the
            presentation and reduce visual distractions.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;
            Problem: Overwhelming or confusing interface with too many features and options can lead to cognitive
            overload
            and reduced productivity.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            Solution: Streamline the user interface and prioritize the most important features, making it easy for users
            to
            find and use the tools they need most frequently. This can include simplifying the navigation structure,
            removing unnecessary features or options, and providing clear visual cues and guidance for users to help
            them
            accomplish their goals.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;
            Problem: Poor accessibility and usability for users with disabilities can create barriers to participation
            and reduce inclusivity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            Solution: Prioritize accessibility features and ensure that the platform is usable for all users, regardless
            of their
            abilities or disabilities. This can include features such as closed captioning, sign language
            interpretation,
            screen reader support, and high-contrast modes, as well as ensuring that the platform is navigable with
            keyboard shortcuts and other assistive technologies. </p>

        <li style="font-size: 130%;">How the empiric laws (Fitt's, Hick's, Steering) might be reconsidered/adapted in
            the context of multi-device interaction?
        </li>

        <p>&nbsp;
            Empiric laws such as Fitts', Hick's, and Steering, were originally developed for single device interaction.
            However, in the context of multi-device interaction, these laws can still be applied, but with some
            adaptations.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            For example, Fitts' law states that the time required to move a pointing device to a target area is a
            function
            of the distance to the target and the size of the target. In the context of multi-device interaction,
            however,
            there may be multiple targets spread across different devices, each with different sizes and distances. As a
            result, the law may need to be adapted to consider the relative sizes and distances of targets across
            devices, and the time required to switch between devices.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            Similarly, Hick's law states that the time required to make a decision is a function of the number of
            options
            available. In the context of multi-device interaction there may be multiple options spread across
            different devices, each with different levels of accessibility and visibility. As a result, the law may need
            to
            be adapted to consider the cognitive load of switching between devices and the visibility of different
            options.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            Steering law states that the time required to navigate a target is a function of the ratio between the
            distance to the target and the width of the target. In the context of multi-device interaction, however,
            there
            may be multiple targets spread across different devices, each with different widths and distances. As a
            result,
            the law may need to be adapted to consider the relative widths and distances of targets across devices, and
            the time required to switch between devices.
        </p>

        <li style="font-size: 130%;">List three new features that can be added to improve the experience and sketch
            those new features on paper and/or digitally. </li>

        <p>&nbsp;
            Finally, three new features that can be added to improve the experience are: collaborative minigames that
            allows users to play simple and fun games where they have to work together, a breakout room feature that
            enables
            participants to have smaller group discussions within a larger meeting, and a virtual assistant that can
            answer
            questions, provide
            information, and take notes during the meeting.
        </p>
